# Project Health Dashboard

This repository houses code that will query the Zooniverse API to retreive project health statistics. 
This data is then collated in a Google Sheet for review by Zooniverse team and community members.

Currently only 'launched' projects are collated but could be extended to other project categories (beta).

The Google sheets ( and occasionally other useful files will be maintained in this [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dJm4R1vDIfTL3ruIfK0KxqRhvoVT15tb?usp=sharing)
